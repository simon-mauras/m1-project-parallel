List of files:

1) exemple_io.c _______________________________________________________________

Small exemple on how to read the input format and write the output format on
one single process. Note that it is possible to perform those read/write in
parallel using MPI-IO, which is however much more complicated.

If you are not using MPI-IO, only one process shall open the file (execute the
load function), and data should then be redistributed using communications.
The same way, writting should be done by a single process hosting all resuls.

2) sample_type1.in & sample_type2.in __________________________________________

Example of input files. Can be read by exemple_io.c

3) viewer.py __________________________________________________________________

Python script used for displaying the results. Have a look at
$ ./viewer.py -h
for more information about all parameters

4) wave_128x128.out && wave_128x128.png _______________________________________

Exemple of output file, and a .png produced by viewer.py from this result file.
Command for generating the .png is
./viewer -i wave_128x128.out -o wave_128x128.png -f png -s 128 128
